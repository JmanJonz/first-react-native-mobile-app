# Overview

I don't plan to go into mobile development as I would prefer to make PWA's however I wanted to be able to learn a little about how to make mobile apps using the skills that I have and so I made this simple react native project.

To use my app you run npm start in the vs code repository. Then in the expo go app on your phone you scan the provided qr code. After that you click on the input add a todo item and then click enter or the plus button and the item will be added. Once you finish an item tap it and it will be deleted. 

I made this app becasue I wanted to learn what I needed to do to create a mobile app using react.

# Development Environment

To make this app I made use of a few key technologies first being vs code as the foundation. I then used react native and expo in order to build it. 

I programmed the whole app using javascript / node.

# Future Work

* Make the todo list scroll as it gets large instead of overflowing below the screen. 
* Add different folders to organized different todo lists into. 
* Do what is necessary to deploy the app and have it downloaded and working on my android phone.
